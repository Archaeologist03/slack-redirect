# slack-redirect

slack-redirect is a node js/Express app which redirects [https://slack.openebs.io](https://slack.openebs.io) to [openebs-community slack link](https://openebs-community.slack.com/join/shared_invite/enQtMjQzMTg4NTcyNTY2LTJiMzVjYjA5ZDk3YmI4NjAxY2QyYmI3MTA1MmUxMTAzNTU0NTM5NTViOTIxMjA1NWQ4NzVmMTBiNjk0NDU1YzQ).

This app is deployed on Heroku, meaning that setup is super easy if you want to use this yourself.

However, [CloudFlare](cloudflare.com) offers a redirect that doesn't require a server app. However, if you want to experiment, go ahead.
